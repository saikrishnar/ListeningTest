      <h1>Audio Rendering of Mathematical Equations</EM></h1>
      <p class="lead">Text to speech (TTS) systems hold promise as an important information access tool .However, audio rendering of mathematical equations using TTS is not very effective till date. This project is aimed at rendering the mathematical equations in an effective way using synthetic speech</p>

      <p>Mathematical equations comprise of different types of visual cues to convey their semantic meaning. Some of these visual cues are superscripts, subscripts, parentheses,etc.The objective of this project is to propose techniques which may unambiguously render the equations in audio.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <p>We hand picked a set of 12 equations and rendered them in audio. The equations consist of different combinations of mathematical attributes that must be ren-
dered differently. The equations also vary in length and the number of variables. It was ensured that the selected equations were semantically unrelated.</p>

    <div class="col-md-4">
      <p>Each participant was made to listen to 18 equations and his responses were recorded. Equations 1-3 were recorded by people familiar with reading math to people with print disabilities. Equations 3 to 6 are rendered with the methods outlined in section 3.1, equations 6 to 9 are rendered using methods outlined in 3.2, equations 10 to 12 using methods from 3.3,
equations 13 to 15 with 3.4 and 16 to 18 with 3.5.</p>

  <p>Screen reader users are familiar to pitch changes. Generally, a high pitch is used to denote capitals and a low pitch is used to denote tool tip messages. On observing the human recorded equations explained in section 2, we observed that speakers
tend to modulate the pitch as they read aloud certain parts of a mathematical expression. It has been observed that certain parts of a mathematical expression are spoken at a faster rate to indicate that it is a sub expression and to isolate it from
the rest of the expression. </p>
